\paragraph{Velocity of center of mass}
Sum of momentum in frame of reference of center of mass is 0:
$$p_{1cm} = -p_{2cm} $$
We want to find velocity of center of mass, so we apply transformation of Lorentz:

$$p_{1cm}  = \gamma_{cm} \left( p_1 - \frac{E_1}{c^2}v_cm \right)$$
$$p_{2cm}  = \gamma_{cm} \left( p_2 - \frac{E_2}{c^2}v_cm \right)$$


$$ \gamma_{cm} \left( p_1 - \frac{E_1}{c^2}v_cm \right) =  -\gamma_{cm} \left( p_2 - \frac{E_2}{c^2}v_cm \right) $$
$$p_1+p_2 = v_{cm}\left( \frac{E_2}{c^2} + \frac{E_1}{c^2} \right)$$

$$v_{cm} = \frac{p_1+p_2}{\frac{E_2}{c^2} + \frac{E_1}{c^2}}$$

Or more generally

$$v_{cm} = \frac{\sum_i p_i}{\sum_i \frac{E_i}{c^2}}$$

So $\frac{E_i}{c^2}$ is replacing Newtonian $m_i$.

\paragraph{DeBroglie Wavelength}

Since $p=\frac{h}{\lambda}$ we can define $\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$ for particles, which is very small.

\paragraph{Threshold energy}
$$p+p \to p+p+p+\bar{p}$$

For resulting particles velocity is very small, i.e. momentum is negligible. So

$$E_{0,cm} = 2\frac{m_pc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$
$$E_cm = 4m_pc^2$$

Then minimal velocity needed for reaction for each proton is:

$$\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}= \frac{1}{2}$$

I.e $v_p = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}c$.

Now lets look at two particles, one is in rest and second is colliding with it. We know that $v_{cm}= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $v_{2cm} =\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Then $v_2$ in lab frame of reference:

$$v_2  = \frac{v_cm+v_{2cm}}{1+ \frac{v_cm\cdot v_{2cm}}{c^2}} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{7}c$$

$$E_2 = \frac{m_pc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=7m_pc^2$$

Threshold kinetic energy when one of the protons is in rest is $6m_pc^2$.

Center of mass frame of reference is optimal, since after collision all the particles are in rest.

It isn't possible to know if we're in free fall towards mass or weightless in space.
